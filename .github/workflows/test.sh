# This script will start an Oracle Database inside a Docker container and then
# execute the Oracle R2DBC test suite with a configuration that has it connect
# to that database.
#
# This script makes no attempt to clean up. The docker container is left
# running, and the database retains the test user and any other modifications
# that the test suite may have performed.
# It is assumed that the Github Runner will clean up any state this script
# leaves behind.


# The startup directory is mounted as a volume inside the docker container.
# The container's entry point script will execute any .sh and .sql scripts
# it finds under /opt/oracle/scripts/startup. The startup scripts are run
# after the database instance is active.A numeric prefix on the script name
# determines the order in which scripts are run. The final script, prefixed
# with "99_" will create a file named "done" in the mounted volumn. When the
# "done" file exists, this signals that the database is active and that all
# startup scripts have completed.

# The oracle/docker-images repo is cloned. This repo provides Dockerfiles along
# with a handy script to build images of Oracle Database. For now, this script
# is just going to build an 18.4.0 XE image, because this can be done in an
# automated fashion, without having to accept license agreements required by
# newer versions like 19 and 21.
# TODO: Also test with newer database versions

# The database port number, 1521, is mapped to the host system. The Oracle
# R2DBC test suite is configured to connect with this port.
